/**
 * Sum square difference
 *
 * Problem 6
 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *
 * 1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *
 * (1+2+...+10)^2=552=3025
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
 * numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.
 *
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
 * natural numbers and the square of the sum.
 *
 * Brainstorming: This one seems pretty simple. I'll make two methods that do
 * each problem and just subtract them.
 *
 * Result:
 * Another first attempt. At this rate I'll be done by june :).
 * Ended up getting:
 * Squares of Sum for 100
 * 25502500
 * Sum of Squares for 100
 * 338350
 * Difference is 25164150
 *
 * Difficulty: 1/10
